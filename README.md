# VGMHelper
This script is just a simple wrapper designed to organize dumps made with multidumper

## Prerequisites
All you need is Wine and wine-mono (if you're on Linux or macOS). Windows users won't need requisites (at least I think)

## Usage
`python VGMHelper.py <vgm path>` OR `python VGMHelper.py`
